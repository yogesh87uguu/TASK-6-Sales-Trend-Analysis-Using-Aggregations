 Analyze monthly revenue and order volume
# ðŸ“Š Task 6: Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Analyze monthly **revenue** and **order volume** from an e-commerce sales dataset using SQL aggregation techniques.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python (for preprocessing and analysis)
- SQLite (SQL syntax used)
- Pandas (for generating results table)
- GitHub (for task submission)

---

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
The dataset `Details.csv` includes:
- Order ID
- Amount
- Profit
- Quantity
- Category
- Sub-Category
- PaymentMode

A synthetic `order_date` column was generated (random dates across 2023) to perform time-based analysis.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Task Summary

SQL operations included:

- Extracting **year** and **month** from `order_date`
- Grouping data by year and month
- Calculating:
  - **Total Revenue** using `SUM(amount)`
  - **Order Volume** using `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`
- Sorting results by date

## ðŸ§  Interview Questions Covered

1. **How do you group data by month and year?**  
   Using `STRFTIME('%Y', order_date)` and `STRFTIME('%m', order_date)` in SQLite.

2. **Difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(DISTINCT col)?**  
   `COUNT(*)` counts all rows, while `COUNT(DISTINCT col)` counts only unique values in a column.

3. **How do you calculate monthly revenue?**  
   `SUM(amount)` grouped by month and year.

4. **What are aggregate functions in SQL?**  
   Functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.

5. **How to handle NULLs in aggregates?**  
   Most aggregate functions ignore `NULL` values by default.

6. **Role of ORDER BY and GROUP BY?**  
   `GROUP BY` groups similar data together, `ORDER BY` sorts the output.

7. **How to get the top 3 months by sales?**  
   Add `ORDER BY total_revenue DESC LIMIT 3`.
